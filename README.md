- 👋 Hi, I’m @XiRO0O

- 👀 I am a 20-year-old "normal" guy living in the European countryside.

- 😻 I am interested in C# (due to my little experience in developing games in Unity), C++, Java (thanks to my modding career in an iconic game called minecraft) and Python (well, i'm learning it at least).

- 😐 Of course, I also know web-based technologies such as JavaScript, node.js, PHP or XML. But I'm not interested in them - I would prefer to develop technology related mainly to backend and of course the graphic aspect of games (that I create more as a hobby).

- 👺 I hate front-enders who really think they're the smartest in the industry. They're just disgustingly stupid and it's not even worth talking to them. Yes, it's about you David.

- 📫 But most importantly - I am still looking for a job in a "dynamic young team", so if you have any interesting offer, let me know: jaseko2002@gmail.com

- 💪 Good luck with your projects samurai.
