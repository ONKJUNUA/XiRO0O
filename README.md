- 👀 I am a 20-year-old "normal" guy living in the European countryside.

- 😻 I am interested in C# (due to my little experience in developing games in Unity), C++ and Python (well, i'm learning it at least).

- 😐 Of course, I also know web-based technologies such as JavaScript, node.js, PHP or XML. But to be honest: I would love to work with Python and its frameworks in the future.

- 📫 And most importantly - I am still looking for a job in a "dynamic young team", so if you have any interesting offer, let me know: jaseko2002@gmail.com

- 💪 Good luck with your projects.
